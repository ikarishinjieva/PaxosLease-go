Extend lease when two node propose
	1. Proposer A got lease, with proposeId = 1
	2. Proposer B retry propose, and retry, ... , for example, proposeId = 5
	3. Proposer A extend lease, with proposeId = 2, which definitely failed

	The step 3 should not fail
---

create 3 nodes
node 1 propose
sleep 1
node 2 propose
assert log "node 1 become lease owner"
clear logs
assert log "node 1 extend its lease"
assert log "node 1 become lease owner"

finally:
stop all nodes
