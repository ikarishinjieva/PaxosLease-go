lease owner should extend its lease if has enough time margin
---

create 3 nodes
node 1 propose
assert log "node 1 become lease owner"
clear logs
sleep 10
assert log "node 1 extend its lease"
assert log "node 1 become lease owner"
assert no log "node 1 preparing is timeout, restart prepraing"
assert no log "node 1 proposing is expired, restart prepraing"

finally:
stop all nodes
